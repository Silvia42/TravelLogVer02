Delete the sqlite database file (often db.sqlite3) 
in your django project folder (or wherever you placed it)

Delete everything except __init__.py file from migration folder 
in all django apps

Make changes in your models (models.py).

Run the command python manage.py makemigrations or python3 manage.py makemigrations

Then run the command python manage.py migrate.

That's all.
